    <h2>Travel Testimonials</h2>

      <p id="testimonials">"Traveling with Gastronomic Journeys to São Paulo was one of the best trips my family and I head!
        It was beyond of what I expected from a gastronomic trip. The most memorable moments were definitely
        those when I was eating with my family. I'm very happy and satisfied with the services Gastronomic
        Journeys provided. Experiencing Brazilian cuisine like a local was my ultimate goal and they nail it."<br>

        Gastronomic Journeys for all the assistance provided on this trip. I was able to enjoy all types of foods and taste 
        something new every day. I'm definitely looking forward to the next trip. However, this time I'll be going with my
        entire family. I truly recommend the services of Gastronomic Journeys to those who look for a new way to travel."<br>

      <p id="testimonials">"Another impeccably organized trip! I appreciate how thoughtful and professional the team was throughout 
        my entire trip in São Paulo. The best part of the tour was when I got to eat different types of meat in one place. 
        I had never experienced something like that. I can say that I love Brazilian churrascarias and caipirinhas.!"<br>

      <p id="testimonials2">"What surprised my husband and me the most on this trip was the culture, cuisine, colors, and smells 
        that each restaurant gave off. This trip to Sao Paulo will be unforgettable. It is always a pleasure to organize a trip 
        with Gastronomic Journeys!"<br>
